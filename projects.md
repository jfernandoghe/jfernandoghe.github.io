## Past projects
### MSc
 - **_Robust calibration in eye tracking_** Several models of eye tracking calibration have been proposed, complex models need more information causing delay on in-use calibration. By following the Parsimony Principle -Occam's Razor- a simple yet accurate and precise calibration is obtained. <br/>
The main idea of this proposal is to compare models using selectors and summary statistics; to accurate determine the best model based on previous techniques. A random sample consensus algorithm is used to ensure robust estimation and evaluation of parameters.<br/>
The best model is selected by person and device; thus, providing personalized selection to a characterized sensor. <br/>
 - **_Pattern detection in eye tracking_** Pattern detection is obtain by raw-data eye tracking -differing from common approaches- enhancing accuracy and precision by decomposing eye tracking scanpaths into sub-sequences -q-grams- providing with a least common sub-sequence (LCS) metric.<br/>
In essence, this algorithm uses raw coordinates (x,y) from eye tracking, decomposing onto q-grams or n-sub sequences of q length. Then, compares each query sub-sequence with the equivalence of the pattern creating a robust metric that finds equivalence between a query and a pattern.<br/>
 - **_Wilderness Search-and-Rescue_** [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665267) A multi-agent search-and-rescue algorithm is develop; agents (as a UAV drone simulation) search for a reward (person) in a given environment. This heuristic metric is simulated with given traits of a particular person and UAV; outperforming sweeping algorithms (Spiral, Lawnmower, Uniform Circular Sector).<br/> This algorithms ensures neither of the agents explore the same territory on the same period of time, most of the area is covered, attraction to high-probability areas; the results show that a reduction in time is achieved with 2-5 agents versus common techniques. <br/>

### BSc
 - **_Smartband_** A smartband prototype is develop to detect hand gestures using computer vision and sensor information (accelerometer and gyroscope). 
A basic GUI is design to help the user connect the device with external environments; usage as mouse and hot-keys for Windows is the principal option.
 - **_Self balance 1d system_** A CAD/CAE fuzzy-controlled 1-degree balance system using 'low-level' linear algebra on MATLAB. Connection from MATLAB was made to visualize in real time assembly movements of the CAD real-model on Solidworks; using Labview as intermediary.
