### PhD
- **_Random forest classifier_**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit Learn, Keras January 2023 - September 2023 
  - Random forest classifier (RFC) using handcrafted semantic-based features for the detection of events of interest in robot state time series.

  - Integration of OCT and visual feedback for autonomous colonoscopic navigation.
  - Orchestration of multiple PCs for autonomous navigation in a physical colon model.
- Robotic endoscope simulator  Python, VTK, TCP/IP October 2021 - May 2022
  - Vision-based simulator for robotic endoscope platforms that reads the state of a human-interface console using sockets.
  - Developed of semantic-based semi-automation approaches for complex surgical tasks.
- **_Dataset creation_**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib February 2020 - January 2021
  - Manual data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and dataset documentation of a dataset of robot state kinematics for multiple surgical gestures.
- **_Statistical model selection_**  Python, Scipy, Google Colab September 2018 - April 2019
  - Developed an algorithm to evaluate statistical models for eye-tracking calibration, reducing the complexity of the models at no expense in performance. The algorithm uses random sample consensus to perform statistical model selection, enabling high accuracy with no prior knowledge.
- **_Heuristic algorithm_**  MATLAB February 2018 - August 2018
  - Developed a heuristic optimisation-based algorithm for search and rescue algorithm for aerial drones, achieving a reduction of 60% and 70% in time and distance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Tested in a virtual MATLAB simulation.

### MSc
 - **_Robust calibration in eye tracking_** Several models of eye tracking calibration have been proposed; complex models need more information, causing a delay in in-use calibration. By following the Parsimony Principle -Occam's Razor- a simple yet accurate and precise calibration is obtained. <br/>
The main idea of this proposal is to compare models using selectors and summary statistics to accurately determine the best model based on previous techniques. A random sample consensus algorithm is used to ensure robust estimation and evaluation of parameters.<br/>
The best model is selected by the person and device; thus, providing personalized selection to a characterised sensor. <br/>
 - **_Pattern detection in eye tracking_** Pattern detection is obtained by raw-data eye tracking -differing from common approaches- enhancing accuracy and precision by decomposing eye tracking scanpaths into sub-sequences -q-grams- providing a least common sub-sequence (LCS) metric.<br/>
In essence, this algorithm uses raw coordinates (x,y) from eye tracking, decomposing onto q-grams or n-sub sequences of q length. Then, compares each query sub-sequence with the equivalence of the pattern, creating a robust metric that finds equivalence between a query and a pattern.<br/>
 - **_Wilderness Search-and-Rescue_** [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665267) A multi-agent search-and-rescue algorithm is developed; agents (as a UAV drone simulation) search for a reward (person) in a given environment. This heuristic metric is simulated with given traits of a particular person and UAV; outperforming sweeping algorithms (Spiral, Lawnmower, Uniform Circular Sector).<br/> This algorithm ensures neither of the agents explores the same territory for the same period of time, most of the area is covered, attraction to high-probability areas; the results show that a reduction in time is achieved with 2-5 agents versus common techniques. <br/>

### BSc
 - **_Smartband_** A smartband prototype is developed to detect hand gestures using computer vision and sensor information (accelerometer and gyroscope). 
A basic GUI is design to help the user connect the device with external environments; usage as a mouse and hot-keys for Windows is the principal option.
 - **_Self balance 1d system_** A CAD/CAE fuzzy-controlled 1-degree balance system using 'low-level' linear algebra on MATLAB. Connection from MATLAB was made to visualise in real time assembly movements of the CAD real-model on Solidworks, using Labview as an intermediary.
